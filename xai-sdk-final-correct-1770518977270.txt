### Non-Biased Review of the Topic
Former President Donald Trump posted a video on his Truth Social platform that included a racist clip depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as apes, which was later deleted by his team. Trump claimed he only viewed the initial part of the video focusing on voter fraud and did not see the offensive ending, refusing to apologize and shifting blame to staff. The incident sparked widespread criticism across political lines, with some Republicans distancing themselves while others downplayed it, highlighting ongoing debates about racism and accountability in politics.

### Left
**Score:** -1 (strongly negative, viewing the incident as clear evidence of Trump's racism and a failure of accountability)  
The political left sees this as a blatant display of racism from Trump, reinforcing their view of him as a divisive figure who promotes harmful stereotypes without remorse. They criticize his refusal to apologize as emblematic of systemic issues within the Republican Party and demand stronger condemnation from all sides. This sentiment fuels calls for greater accountability and highlights concerns about the normalization of racist rhetoric in American politics.

**Example Tweets:**

   **Tweet Text:** Trump posted a disgustingly racist video depicting the Obamas as apes. Are my Republican colleagues going to continue to bend the knee to a racist, authoritarian president who wants the American people to bow down before him?

   **Tweet Text:** "There's something about Donald Trump that has created a culture amongst those around him that they think it's okay to post this," @MoElleithee says after a racist video depicting the Obamas as apes was posted to, then removed from Trump's Truth Social account. "And when they get the blowback, they think it's fine to defend it, which is just as offensive to me as posting it in the first place by calling it fake outrage... And they still have not apologized."

### Right
**Score:** 0.5 (moderately positive, defending Trump by downplaying the racism or framing criticism as overblown partisan attacks)  
The political right often defends Trump by arguing the video was not intentionally racist or was meant as satire, dismissing outrage as manufactured by opponents. They shift focus to other issues like voter fraud mentioned in the video and accuse critics of selective hypocrisy. This group feels the incident is being exaggerated to politically harm Trump, viewing his response as justified.
