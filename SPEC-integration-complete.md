### ✅ FOMC minutes showed Powell to remain as Chair for all of 2026. Gridlock, here's why.

- **Time:** 62.9s
- **Story ID:** 344
- **Posts:** LEFT=3, CENTER=3, RIGHT=3
- **Summary:** The FOMC minutes confirm that Jerome Powell was elected as Chair for the entirety of 2026 until a successor is formally selected and installed, serving as a reminder of the committee's governance framework to avoid leadership vacuums. Potential delays in confirming President Trump's nominee Kevin Warsh are driven by Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) withholding support for Fed nominees until a DOJ investigation into Powell is resolved, compounded by Democrats advocating postponements to safeguard Fed independence. This situation heightens market uncertainty regarding the Fed leadership transition and its implications for policy continuity.

### ✅ Another blue state launches counterattack as Trump and GOP 'rig' Congressional elections

- **Time:** 64.4s
- **Story ID:** 345
- **Posts:** LEFT=2, CENTER=3, RIGHT=3
- **Summary:** A group named Coloradans for a Level Playing Field has proposed a ballot initiative for Colorado voters to approve a temporary congressional redistricting map for the 2028 and 2030 elections, potentially giving Democrats a 7-1 advantage over the current 4-4 split by making three Republican-held districts more competitive while keeping Rep. Lauren Boebert's district Republican-leaning. The proposal pauses the state's independent redistricting commission, established in 2018, and reverts to it after the 2030 census, framed as a counter to Republican-led mid-decade redistricting in states like Texas amid national battles ahead of the 2026 midterms. Partisan reactions are stark: progressives see it as defensive against GOP 'rigging,' while conservatives decry it as hypocritical gerrymandering by a dark-money group.

### ✅ Olympics Hit With Complaint by Federation Amid New Judging Controversy

- **Time:** 50.0s
- **Story ID:** 346
- **Posts:** LEFT=0, CENTER=3, RIGHT=0
- **Summary:** During the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics short track speed skating 500-meter semi-final, Italian skater Pietro Sighel fell after being hit by Canadian Maxime Laoun during an overtake attempt, resulting in his elimination despite a video review that did not reinstate him. The Italian Ice Sports Federation filed a formal complaint against the judges and the International Skating Union, alleging inconsistent and contradictory decisions by the same judge in treating Sighel across multiple events at the Games. The federation noted that their concerns are shared by officials from other nations and criticized the ISU for failing to intervene to ensure fairness.

**Sample CENTER post:**
> @Giorgio Spalluto @GeorgeSpalluto: La FISG su #Sighel: "Abbiamo assistito a decisioni incoerenti e contraddittorie da parte dello stesso giudice nel trattamento riservato a Pietro Sighel nel corso di questa Olimpiade. La nostra opinione è stata confermata ed è condivisa anche da tecnici e dirigenti di altre nazioni presenti ai Giochi, che hanno espresso perplessità analoghe rispetto a quanto visto sul ghiaccio. Questo rende il quadro ancora più grave e preoccupante. La Federazione ritiene estremamente problematico il fatto che la International Skating Union non sia stata capace di intervenire nel corso dell’evento per porre fine a un operato del tutto fuori luogo. Comprendiamo i regolamenti e il ruolo degli ufficiali di gara, ma quando emergono elementi così evidenti di incoerenza, è doveroso intervenire per garantire equità durante l’evento stesso".

### ✅ Taliban Just Made It Legal for Husbands to Beat Wives - As Long As No Bones Are Broken

- **Time:** 39.0s
- **Story ID:** 347
- **Posts:** LEFT=3, CENTER=3, RIGHT=3
- **Summary:** The Taliban has issued a new 90-page criminal code signed by supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, which permits husbands and 'slave masters' to administer ta’zir discretionary beatings to wives and subordinates as long as no broken bones or serious injuries result. Women seeking justice for excessive violence face stringent requirements, including proving injuries to a judge while covered and accompanied by a male guardian, with the maximum penalty for husbands being 15 days in prison. The code reinforces a punitive hierarchy favoring elites and religious scholars amid ongoing Taliban restrictions on women's education, employment, and freedoms.

### ✅ U.S. military prepared to strike Iran as early as this weekend, but Trump has yet to make a final call, sources say

- **Time:** 54.0s
- **Story ID:** 348
- **Posts:** LEFT=3, CENTER=3, RIGHT=2
- **Summary:** The U.S. military has positioned significant air and naval assets in the Middle East, including the USS Gerald Ford carrier group, preparing for potential strikes on Iran as early as this weekend, according to sources familiar with the matter. President Trump has not made a final decision, prioritizing diplomacy through indirect Geneva talks that have agreed on principles but stalled on details, while consulting national security advisers. Timing may be influenced by the Winter Olympics closing, Ramadan's start, and Trump's State of the Union address.
