## LEFT Perspective (score: +0.4)
*Left views Powell's extended tenure as a check against Trump undermining Fed independence*

| @SenWarren | "🧵The biggest cheerleaders for Trump's nominee for Fed Chair? Big Bank CEOs. Why? Follow the money – Warsh helped orchestrate the Wall Street bailouts back in 2008 while people were losing jobs left and right." | https://x.com/SenWarren/status/2019901314906337488 |
| @SenWarren | "Who is Kevin Warsh, Trump's nominee to be Fed Chair?" | https://x.com/SenWarren/status/2019130021735198967 |
| @atrupar | "Tillis: \"I know how I'd react to this. I'd be there for the remaining two years, because I don't think you reward bad behavior. But that's a decision that Chair Powell makes.\"" | https://x.com/atrupar/status/2019066387293999552 |

## CENTER Perspective (score: 0.0)
*Centrists treat it as procedural governance, note bipartisan obstacles*

| @NickTimiraos | "So this is one part quirk of the transition coming roughly five months (instead of five days) after the January meeting officer elections, but also a good reminder of FOMC governance — the default position is that Powell is chair of the FOMC until he's not." | https://x.com/NickTimiraos/status/2024269176261558644 |
| @macroderek | "Powell was selected as FOMC Chair for the whole of 2026 until there is a successor: per FOMC Minutes..." | https://x.com/macroderek/status/2024200027476734394 |
| @LaMonicaBuzz | "A divided Fed? The clock is ticking on Powell's tenure as chair. @NicoleGoodkind has a look at what the central bank discussed in the last meeting." | https://x.com/LaMonicaBuzz/status/2024206749843026073 |

## RIGHT Perspective (score: -0.5)
*Right frustrated by gridlock delaying Warsh confirmation, sees it as obstruction*

| Author | Post | URL |
|--------|------|-----|
| @xwastheone | "Day 17 since the informal nomination of Kevin Warsh. All 11 Banking Committee Democrats demand delay until both the Powell and Cook investigations end. Tillis holds. 12-12. Deadlock. 89 days until Powell's term ends. Tick tock." | https://x.com/xwastheone/status/2023107798171898032 |
| @wesbury | "This Fed, and Powell, are resisting and flexing in the only way they know how. 'Let's say we will raise rates…that will make it even more difficult for Warsh to cut.' This is about politics." | https://x.com/wesbury/status/2024241955509555537 |
| @LukeGromen | "if he doesn't cut rates and the long end rises as well, then what? This is Powell's parting gift to Warsh - the fuse he lit by hiking rates in 2022 is about to go *boom*" | https://x.com/LukeGromen/status/2019437295867441396 |
