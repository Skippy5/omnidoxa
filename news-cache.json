        "description": "Iran’s exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi is urging world leaders to crank up pressure on Iran’s government. Speaking Saturday on the sidelines of a security conference in Munich, Germany, Pahlavi warned of the likelihood of more deaths in Iran if “democracies stand by and watch.” He has called for rallies in Munich, Los Angeles and Toronto on Saturday in a “global day of action.” Iranian leaders are already under intense pressure, facing renewed threats of U.S. military action from President Donald Trump.",
