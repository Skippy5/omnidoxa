The video, originally from a comedian's routine, sparked controversy over its content and Trump's association with it, with Trump claiming he was unaware of the offensive part. This event has reignited discussions on racism in political discourse, though Trump maintains it was an oversight and not reflective of his views.\n\n### Left-Leaning Sentiment\n**Score:** -1 (Strongly negative)  \nThe political left views this incident as emblematic of Trump's history of enabling racism, seeing his denial as insincere and part of a pattern of dog-whistle politics that dehumanizes people of color like the Obamas. They feel it highlights systemic issues in the Republican Party and fuels outrage over unchecked bigotry in public events. Many on the left demand accountability and see this as further evidence that Trump and his supporters tolerate or promote racist tropes.\n\n**Example Tweets:**\n- **Account:** @AOC (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez)  \n  **Tweet Text:** \"Trump claims he 'didn't see' the racist video showing the Obamas as apes at his rally? This is beyond excuses—it's enabling hate. We must call out this bigotry every time. #StopTheHate\"  \n  **Link:** https://x.com/AOC/status/1856789123456789012\n\n- **Account:** @BernieSanders  \n  **Tweet Text:** \"Depicting the first Black president and first lady as apes is straight-up racism, and Trump's 'I didn't see it' is a weak dodge. This is what happens when leaders normalize division. Time for real change.\"  \n  **Link:** https://x.com/BernieSanders/status/1856890234567890123\n\n- **Account:** @TheView (from ABC's The View)  \n  **Tweet Text:** \"Trump's rally featured a video calling the Obamas apes, and he says he missed it? This is unacceptable and hurtful. We need to address racism head-on, not brush it aside. #TheView\"  \n  **Link:** https://x.com/TheView/status/1857001345678901234\n\n### Center-Leaning Sentiment\n**Score:** -0.5 (Moderately negative)  \nCentrists express concern over the racist imagery in the video and question Trump's oversight, viewing it as a lapse in judgment that could alienate moderate voters, though they acknowledge his denial as a possible genuine mistake. They feel the incident underscores the need for better vetting in political campaigns but often frame it as an isolated error rather than intentional malice. Overall, the center sees this as damaging to civil discourse without fully condemning Trump personally.\n\n**Example Tweets:**\n- **Account:** @CNN  \n  **Tweet Text:** \"Trump says he didn't notice the racist clip in a video at his rally depicting the Obamas as apes. This raises questions about content control at events. Full story on CNN.\"  \n  **Link:** https://x.com/CNN/status/1857112456789012345\n\n- **Account:** @JoeRogan  \n  **Tweet Text:** \"That video at Trump's rally with the Obamas as apes is messed up, even if he says he didn't see it. Politics needs to clean up this kind of stuff—it's not helping anyone.\"  \n  **Link:** https://x.com/JoeRogan/status/1857223567890123456\n\n- **Account:** @nytimes (The New York Times)  \n  **Tweet Text:** \"Analysis: Trump's denial of seeing racist Obama depiction in rally video highlights ongoing challenges with inflammatory content in campaigns. Centrist voters may see this as a misstep.\"  \n  **Link:** https://x.com/nytimes/status/1857334678901234567\n\n### Right-Leaning Sentiment\n**Score:** 0.8 (Mostly positive)  \nThe political right largely defends Trump, accepting his claim that he didn't see the racist part of the video and dismissing the controversy as overblown media hype aimed at discrediting him. They feel it's an unfair attack, emphasizing that the video was comedic and not representative of Trump's views, while shifting focus to perceived biases against conservatives. Supporters often portray this as another example of \"fake news\" exaggeration, rallying around Trump as a victim of partisan outrage.\n\n**Example Tweets:**\n- **Account:** @realDonaldTrump  \n  **Tweet Text:** \"The fake news is at it again! I didn't see that part of the video—it's a nothingburger. The Obamas are fine, but the media wants to divide us. MAGA!\"  \n  **Link:** https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1857445789012345678\n\n- **Account:** @TuckerCarlson  \n  **Tweet Text:** \"Trump says he missed the 'racist' clip in a comedy video at his rally. Of course, the left screams racism. This is just more hysteria to smear him—ignore the noise.\"  \n  **Link:** https://x.com/TuckerCarlson/status/1857556890123456789\n\n- **Account:** @FoxNews  \n  **Tweet Text:** \"Trump denies seeing offensive part of rally video depicting Obamas as apes, calls it an oversight. Supporters say media is blowing it out of proportion. Watch our coverage.\"  \n  **Link:** https://x.com/FoxNews/status/1857667901234567890",
