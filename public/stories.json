In return, India has agreed to cease its purchases of Russian oil and lower other trade barriers. This agreement aims to improve trade flows and strengthen relations between the two nations.",

They could argue that the agreement overlooks the need for sustainable energy alternatives and might inadvertently support U.S. imperialism by pressuring allies to align against Russia. Overall, liberals may see it as a short-term geopolitical win that doesn't tackle broader issues like climate change or economic inequality.",
